# I have problem in Rstudion, that's why I write it in GitHub



# Step 1 : Create a new R Markdown file (e.g., map_example.Rmd) with the following content:

---
title: "Interactive Map with Leaflet"
author: "Mohamed Elmehdi Ait Bourkha"
date: "`01-08-2024`"
output: 
  html_document:
    self_contained: true
---

## Interactive Map

Below is an interactive map created using Leaflet:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(leaflet)





# Step 2 : 

# Create a Leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -73.985, lat = 40.748, popup = "Empire State Building") %>%
  setView(lng = -73.985, lat = 40.748, zoom = 13)



# Step 3 : 

### Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio, and click the "Knit" button to generate the HTML output. This will create an HTML file (`map_example.html`) that contains the interactive map.

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., `leaflet-map-example`).

2. **Upload Your Files:**
   - Upload your `map_example.html` file to this repository.

3. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch you uploaded your files to (e.g., `main`) and the root directory.
   - Save the settings.

4. **Access Your Page:**
   - After a few minutes, your page should be live. You can access it at `https://yourusername.github.io/leaflet-map-example/map_example.html`.
